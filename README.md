# CubeX-Engine
## üï∂Ô∏è Overview
I've made this a public repository as the project has reached a stage where a single contribution is no longer enough to complete it. This serves as both a learning resource and a foundation for building upon the base engine.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation & Build
- You need following libraries installed: `vulkan`, `stb`, `glfw3`, `cglm`
- Clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nelo-dev/cubex-engine.git` as its depends on [vkutils](https://github.com/nelo-dev/vkutils)
- Finally build with scripts: `build.sh` (linux) and `build.bat` (windows)
